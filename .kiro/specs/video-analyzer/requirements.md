# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Video Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze videos in great detail, providing comprehensive insights about various aspects of video content. Using PyDantic-AI agent and OpenAI's LLM capabilities, the system will break down videos into their constituent elements, analyzing hooks, progression, scenes, lighting, mood, storyline, and objects. The goal is to help content creators learn from existing videos to create more engaging content in the future.
